# PickAPic

***Currently I'm recreating this project with ReactJS in another [branch](https://github.com/LihayMorad/PickAPic/tree/recreate-with-react).***


### A website for photographers to share and find hotspot photo locations.

This project was made during a course I took at my college.

I had to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript on my own which was very interesting and challenging, but the progress I made just kept me wanting to improve my code even more.



> Client-Side: HTML, CSS and Javascript, jQuery, Ajax, Google Maps API.


> Server-Side: ASP .NET Web API with IIS Server - C#
