### A website for photographers to share and find hotspot photo locations.



This project was made during a course I took at my college.

I had to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript on my own which was very interesting and challenging but the progress just kept me want to improve it even further more.



> The client-side: HTML, CSS and JavaScript, jQuary, Ajax. API: Google Maps API (plus 'Places' library).


> The server-side: C# (I used ASP .NET Web API with IIS Server)
